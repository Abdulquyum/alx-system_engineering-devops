<h1>Web Stack Monitoring</h1>
<h3>Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories<h3>
<ul><li>Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected</li>
<li>Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)</li></ul>
